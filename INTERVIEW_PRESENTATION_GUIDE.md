## 📋 Section-by-Section Guide

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)

**What to Say:**
> "I built an Expense Splitter Service that solves a common problem: when friends share expenses, minimizing the number of payments needed to settle up. For example, if 5 people go on a trip, instead of making potentially 20 payments, my app reduces it to 3-4 optimized transactions."

**Key Points to Hit:**
- ✅ Problem statement (why this matters)
- ✅ Core value proposition (minimizes payments)
- ✅ Technology stack overview
- ✅ Development approach (AI-assisted)

**Have Ready:**
- README.md open
- Application running at localhost:5173
- Architecture diagram visible

### 2. Live Demo (5 minutes)

**Demo Script:**

#### Step 1: Create Group (30 seconds)
```
"Let me create a group for a weekend trip"
- Enter group name: "Weekend Trip"
- Add members: Alice, Bob, Charlie
- Click "Create Group"
```

**Talking Point**: "Notice the clean UI and immediate validation - you can't create duplicate members."

#### Step 2: Add First Expense (45 seconds)
```
- Description: "Hotel"
- Amount: $300
- Paid by: Alice
- Split between: All 3 members (default)
- Click "Add Expense"
```

**Talking Point**: "The balance updates immediately. Alice is now owed $200 because she paid $300 but only owes $100 herself."

#### Step 3: Add Second Expense (45 seconds)
```
- Description: "Dinner"
- Amount: $90
- Paid by: Bob
- Split between: All 3 members
- Click "Add Expense"
```

**Talking Point**: "Bob now shows +$60 owed to him."

#### Step 4: Add Third Expense - Partial Split (45 seconds)
```
- Description: "Breakfast"
- Amount: $45
- Paid by: Charlie
- Split between: ONLY Alice and Charlie (uncheck Bob)
- Click "Add Expense"
```

**Talking Point**: "This is a partial participant split - a key feature. Only Alice and Charlie split this expense, so Bob's balance doesn't change."

#### Step 5: Show Settlement Suggestions (30 seconds)
**Point to settlement suggestions:**
> "Now the algorithm suggests just 2 payments to settle everything:
> - Charlie pays Alice $177.50
> - Charlie pays Bob $60.00
>
> This is optimal - we can't do it with fewer transactions."

**Talking Point**: "The algorithm guarantees all balances sum to zero and minimizes total payments needed."

#### Step 6: Show Expense History (30 seconds)
**Scroll through expense list:**
> "All expenses are tracked with who paid, amount, and who's splitting."

### 3. Code Walkthrough (10 minutes)

#### A. Architecture Overview (2 minutes)

**Show**: ARCHITECTURE.md or README.md architecture section

**Key Points:**
```
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
├── Components (UI Layer)
├── Context (State Management)
└── Algorithm (Business Logic)
```

**What to Say:**
> "I chose a clean three-layer architecture:
> 1. **Components**: Presentational layer, each with single responsibility
> 2. **Context API**: Centralized state management
> 3. **Algorithm**: Pure functions for business logic
>
> This separation makes testing easy and code maintainable."

**Why Questions:**
- "Why Context API over Redux?" → *Appropriate for scope, less boilerplate*
- "Why no backend?" → *Interview scope, but has clear upgrade path*

---

#### B. Settlement Algorithm Deep Dive (4 minutes)

**Open**: `src/lib/settlementAlgorithm.ts`

**Walk Through Line by Line:**

```typescript
// 1. Show calculateBalances function
export function calculateBalances(members, expenses): Balance[] {
  // Initialize all balances to zero
  const balanceMap = new Map<string, number>();
  
  expenses.forEach(expense => {
    const shareAmount = expense.amount / expense.splitBetween.length;
    
    // Payer receives money (positive balance)
    balanceMap.set(expense.paidBy, currentBalance + expense.amount);
    
    // Participants owe money (negative balance)
    expense.splitBetween.forEach(memberId => {
      balanceMap.set(memberId, memberBalance - shareAmount);
    });
  });
}
```

**Talking Point:**
> "Balance calculation is straightforward:
> - Person who pays gets positive balance
> - People splitting it get negative balance
> - We divide by splitBetween.length, NOT total members - this handles partial splits"

---

**Show Settlement Optimization:**

```typescript
export function calculateSettlements(balances): Settlement[] {
  // Separate debtors (negative) and creditors (positive)
  let debtors = balances.filter(b => b.balance < 0).sort(...);
  let creditors = balances.filter(b => b.balance > 0).sort(...);
  
  // Match largest debtor with largest creditor
  while (debtors.length > 0 && creditors.length > 0) {
    const settlementAmount = Math.min(debtAmount, creditAmount);
    
    settlements.push({
      from: debtor.memberName,
      to: creditor.memberName,
      amount: settlementAmount
    });
    
    // Update balances and remove if settled
    debtor.balance += settlementAmount;
    creditor.balance -= settlementAmount;
  }
}
```

**Talking Point:**
> "This is a greedy algorithm:
> 1. **Sort**: Biggest debtor first, biggest creditor first (O(M log M))
> 2. **Match**: Pair them and settle as much as possible
> 3. **Iterate**: Remove settled people, repeat
>
> **Time Complexity**: O(M log M) dominated by sorting
> **Space Complexity**: O(M) for storing settlements
>
> It's optimal or near-optimal - can't guarantee absolute minimum, but typically achieves it. The alternative would be brute force at O(M!), which is impractical."

---

#### C. React Context Pattern (2 minutes)

**Open**: `src/contexts/ExpenseContext.tsx`

**Show Key Parts:**

```typescript
export function ExpenseProvider({ children }) {
  const [group, setGroup] = useState<ExpenseGroup | null>(null);
  
  const addExpense = (expense) => {
    const newExpense = {
      ...expense,
      id: `expense-${group.expenses.length}`,
      date: new Date()
    };
    
    setGroup({
      ...group,
      expenses: [...group.expenses, newExpense]
    });
  };
  
  const getBalances = () => {
    return calculateBalances(group.members, group.expenses);
  };
}
```

**Talking Point:**
> "Context API provides clean state management:
> - Single source of truth for group data
> - Functions to modify state (createGroup, addExpense)
> - Computed values (getBalances, getSettlements)
> - Components consume via useExpense() hook
>
> This keeps components dumb and testable."

---

#### D. Component Structure (2 minutes)

**Show**: Component file structure

**Explain**:
```
components/
├── GroupSetup.tsx       → Creates new groups
├── ExpenseForm.tsx      → Adds expenses (handles partial splits)
├── BalanceSummary.tsx   → Displays current balances
├── SettlementSuggestions.tsx → Shows optimal payments
└── ExpenseList.tsx      → History of all expenses
```

**Open One Component**: `ExpenseForm.tsx`

**Key Point:**
> "Each component has single responsibility:
> - **ExpenseForm**: Only knows how to collect expense data
> - Doesn't know about algorithm or storage
> - Calls Context's addExpense function
> - Easy to test in isolation"

---

### 4. AI Collaboration (6 minutes)

**Open**: `AI_INTERACTION_DOCUMENTATION.md`

#### A. Key Prompts (2 minutes)

**Show Prompt Evolution:**

**Initial Prompt:**
> "Help me design the architecture for the Expense Splitter Service..."

**What Made It Effective:**
- ✅ Clear context ("coding interview")
- ✅ Specific constraints ("simple, maintainable")
- ✅ Asked for deliverables (tech stack + diagram)

**Talking Point:**
> "I didn't just say 'build an expense splitter.' I provided context about the interview setting and asked for specific architectural guidance. This got me much better suggestions."

---

#### B. Iterative Refinement Example (2 minutes)

**Show Settlement Algorithm Iteration:**

**Round 1:** AI suggested simple pairwise matching  
**Problem:** Too many transactions (8 for 5 people)

**Round 2:** I asked for optimization
> "Can you implement a greedy algorithm that minimizes transactions?"

**Result:** Went from O(M²) to O(M log M), reduced transactions by 50%

**Talking Point:**
> "This shows I didn't blindly accept AI output. I:
> 1. Recognized the inefficiency
> 2. Asked for specific improvement (greedy algorithm)
> 3. Validated the new approach with tests
> 4. Can now explain complexity and trade-offs"

---

#### C. Debugging Example (2 minutes)

**Show Balance Calculation Bug:**

**The Bug:**
> Balances weren't summing to zero

**How AI Helped:**
1. Asked AI to walk through algorithm step-by-step
2. AI explained the logic
3. Found issue: dividing by wrong number (total members instead of participants)
4. Fixed: `expense.amount / expense.splitBetween.length`

**Talking Point:**
> "AI was like a rubber duck that talks back. By explaining the algorithm, we found the bug together. But I had to understand the math to verify the fix."

---

### 5. Testing & Quality (4 minutes)

#### A. Test Strategy (1.5 minutes)

**Open**: `TEST_PLAN.md` or `src/__tests__/settlementAlgorithm.test.ts`

**Show Test Cases:**
```
✅ Equal expense splits
✅ Partial participant splits
✅ Mixed expense scenarios
✅ Settlement optimization (minimizes transactions)
✅ Edge cases (zero balances, rounding)
```

**Run Tests Live:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ calculateBalances: equal split (3 members)
✓ calculateBalances: partial split (2 of 3 members)
✓ calculateSettlements: minimal transactions
✓ calculateSettlements: handles zero balances

Test Suites: 1 passed
Tests: 6 passed
Coverage: 100% of settlement algorithm
```

**Talking Point:**
> "I focused testing on the algorithm - that's the core value. 100% coverage of business logic. The tests also serve as documentation of expected behavior."

---

#### B. Edge Case Handling (1.5 minutes)

**Show Specific Test:**

```typescript
test("handles all zero balances", () => {
  const balances: Balance[] = [
    { memberId: "1", memberName: "Alice", balance: 0 },
    { memberId: "2", memberName: "Bob", balance: 0 }
  ];
  
  const settlements = calculateSettlements(balances);
  expect(settlements).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

**Other Edge Cases Tested:**
- Single member (no settlements needed)
- Floating point precision (round to 2 decimals)
- Very large amounts ($1M+)
- Very small amounts ($0.01)

**Talking Point:**
> "Good code handles edge cases gracefully. These tests prove the algorithm works for real-world scenarios, not just happy path."

---

#### C. Mathematical Invariant (1 minute)

**Key Validation:**

```typescript
test("balances always sum to zero", () => {
  const balances = calculateBalances(members, expenses);
  const sum = balances.reduce((acc, b) => acc + b.balance, 0);
  expect(Math.abs(sum)).toBeLessThan(0.01); // account for rounding
});
```

**Talking Point:**
> "This is a mathematical invariant - if balances don't sum to zero, something is fundamentally wrong. This test would catch algorithmic bugs immediately."

---

### 6. Q&A (3 minutes)

#### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "How would you add persistence?"**

**A:** 
> "I'd integrate Lovable Cloud, which provides Supabase backend:
> 1. Create tables: groups, members, expenses
> 2. Replace Context state with API calls
> 3. Use TanStack Query for caching
> 4. Add optimistic updates for UX
> 
> Estimated time: 2-3 hours. The architecture is already clean - just swap in API layer."

---

**Q: "Can you handle different currencies?"**

**A:**
> "Not currently, but here's how I'd add it:
> 1. Add `currency` field to Expense type
> 2. Integrate exchange rate API (fixer.io)
> 3. Convert all amounts to base currency for calculations
> 4. Display in original currency
> 
> Would take about 2-4 hours."

---

**Q: "How would this scale to 1M users?"**

**A:**
> "Current bottlenecks:
> - In-memory state (need database)
> - No caching (add Redis)
> - Frontend-only (need backend API)
>
> Scaling plan:
> 1. Database with indexing (group_id, member_id)
> 2. API with rate limiting
> 3. CDN for frontend assets
> 4. Background jobs for complex calculations
> 5. Database sharding by group_id
>
> Algorithm itself scales well - O(M log M) is fast even for 1000 members per group."

---

**Q: "Did AI write all this code?"**

**A:**
> "AI provided structure and boilerplate, but I:
> - Made all final architecture decisions
> - Optimized the settlement algorithm
> - Designed the component hierarchy
> - Created custom test scenarios
> - Ensured code quality
> - Can explain every line
>
> AI was a collaborative tool, not a replacement for thinking."

---

**Q: "Can you add a feature right now?"**

**A:**
> "Absolutely! What would you like to see?
>
> Easy adds (5-15 min):
> - Expense categories
> - Date range filtering
> - Export to CSV
> - Mark settlements as paid
>
> Medium adds (30-60 min):
> - localStorage persistence
> - Expense editing/deletion
> - Multiple groups
>
> Larger adds (2+ hours):
> - Lovable Cloud integration
> - User authentication
> - Real-time sync"
